/**---------Introduction to Digital Circuits - Basic Building Blocks using VHDL------------**/

This project introduces the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, implemented and simulated using the VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language).
It provides a comprehensive guide to understanding digital circuit design concepts and their implementation in VHDL code for various digital design and FPGA project.
